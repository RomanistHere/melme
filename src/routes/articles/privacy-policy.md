Information we collect:

- **Content you provide**. Our service is user-content based, meaning we collect, store and display content users provide. See [terms of use](terms-of-use) for more.
- **Some of user interactions**. We use Plausible for analytics. It doesn't collect personal info and results are open for everyone: [https://plausible.io/melme.io](https://plausible.io/melme.io)
- **Some technical details**. For example, we store [IP address for 20 minutes](https://github.com/RomanistHere/melme/blob/master/src/routes/submit-event/%2Bpage.server.js#L11) when user submits events. This is done as an anti-spam protection, which would not allow user to submit more than 5 listings within 20 minutes range.

Reasons we collect this information:

- **Provide users an opportunity to share events**. It's fun and useful!
- **See the general information about how service is used**. It's fun, but not that useful.
- **Protect users from different sorts of attacks**. It's not fun, but useful.

General notes:

- melme is **[open source](https://github.com/RomanistHere/melme/) project**, meaning you can actually go and see code for yourself. It's hosted on Vercel with Cloudflare protection.
- This policy is subject to change in the future.
- This service **is not intended for children under 13 years of age**. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you are under 13, please do not provide any information.
