So, Dubai is kinda expensive, but there are ways to spend less for the same things. Let's go through them!

There are green bikes everywhere in the city:

You can download [the official app](https://www.careem.com/en-ae/careem-bike/) and buy a plan for a month, for example. But it will cost 75 AED.

What you can do instead, is to download [Careem app](https://www.careem.com/en-ae/) and activate Careem Plus. First month comes for free, and afterwards is going to be only 20 AED per month - but it gives you free Careem bikes with this subscription, as well as other bonuses, like 10% cashback on taxi rides, 20-50% off on food delivery, etc.

Another thing about the Careem app - it comes with 20-50% off on first order in food delivery. So if you're a not a resident, but planning to become one (with getting approved, you'll lose your tourist mobile number and will need to get another one) - before you lose your tourist number, register in careem and enjoy free Careem Plus for month with lots of half-priced food from the delivery.

There are places, you can visit for free every or almost every day. Here's a [separate article](dubai-free-places) with information about them.
