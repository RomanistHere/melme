# melme - more events for less money

Community based project, which was born on [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/dubai/comments/z68pza/i_want_to_make_a_free_events_in_dubai_appsite_but/), designed by [digital4ddict](https://www.reddit.com/user/digital4ddict) and implemented by RomanistHere during the first two weeks.

**Current stage:** MVP.

**Idea behind:** App for sharing interesting free (mainly) encounters as well as planned events. Imagine: you sit home, wondering what to do. Places you've been to, do not awaken interest in you anymore. You're confused. You know you want some movement, something new, but what?.. with who? Here when melme comes. We'll find you interesting events, parties and other social encounters as well as people to hang out with, people who want to experience new things just like you. In return we just want to ask you to share events you know about with us - spreading good across the Globe.

**Current features:**
- Submit event without registration
- Save events for later
- Filter by categories
- Show live events

**In development:**
- Map view
- Registration/personal recommendations
- Comments/pictures/videos/reviews/ratings for events and organisers
- 

**Tech stack:** SvelteKit + Tailwind, MongoDB + Mongoose, Vercel + Cloudflare
