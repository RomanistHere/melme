# melme - more events for less money

Community based project, which started as a [reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/dubai/comments/z68pza/i_want_to_make_a_free_events_in_dubai_appsite_but/), was designed by [digital4ddict](https://www.reddit.com/user/digital4ddict) and implemented by RomanistHere during the first two weeks.

**Current stage:** MVP.

**Reason:** There were no adequate single place, where one could find free events. Sorry, visitdubai, you tried...

**Idea behind:** App for sharing interesting free (mainly) encounters as well as planned events. Imagine: you sit home, wondering what to do. Places you've been to, do not awaken interest in you anymore. You're confused. You know you want some movement, something new, but what?.. with who? Here when melme comes. We'll find you interesting events, parties and other social encounters as well as people to hang out with, people who want to experience new things just like you. In return we just want to ask you to share events you know about with us - spreading good across ~~the Globe~~Dubai.

**Current features:**

- Submit and see events without registration
- Save events for later
- Filter by categories
- Show live events
- Anti-spam protection, events go through moderation before coming to the main feed. However you're able to see it if you want

**In development:**

- Map view
- Registration for syncing, personal recommendations, moderation
- Comments/pictures/videos/reviews/ratings for events and organizers
- Sharing live events "on fly" when you encounter them

**Tech stack:** SvelteKit + Tailwind, MongoDB + Mongoose, Vercel + Cloudflare

## Supporting the project

Grab your lazy ass and go tell someone about this project. Seriously, there are hundreds of digital portals, newspapers, influencers, other people. If we got review somewhere, it would be awesome. Just send 1 person our story and let them know how cool we are!

Anyway, literally everything is appreciated: money, connections, cloud hostings, feedback, social media sharing, submitting events, writing code, designing, simple using - I'm sure almost everyone can give something. If you use and/or like melme, if you want it to keep up: to be handy, free, community based - give something back. Author of this text gave almost 2 full weeks (on the moment of writing) of his time for this project and does not regret it a bit.
